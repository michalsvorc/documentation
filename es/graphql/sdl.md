GraphQL enables declarative data fetching where the client can specify exactly what data it needs from an API. GraphQL minimizes the amount of data that needs to be transferred over the network and thus majorly improves applications operating under these conditions. During execution, GraphQL will wait for Promises, Futures, and Tasks to complete before continuing and will do so with optimal concurrency.

# Types

In every GraphQL schema, you can define your own scalar and object types. An often cited example for a custom scalar would be a Date type where the implementation needs to define how that type is validated, serialized, and deserialized.

## Scalar Types \


They represent concrete units of data. The GraphQL spec has five predefined scalars:

- String

- Int

- Float

- Boolean

- ID

## Object Types \


They have fields that express the properties of that type and are composable.
