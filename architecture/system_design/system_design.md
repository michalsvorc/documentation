## Functional vs non-functional requirements

- [Examples](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/non-functional-requirements-examples)

In contrast to functional requirements, nonfunctional features are not mandatory for a system to operate. Instead, these
features can help differentiate an application from other products on the market.

Functional requirements encompass what a system does, while nonfunctional requirements cover how a system completes a task.

While functional requirements focus on the purpose of an application, nonfunctional requirements center on the users'
expectations, such as the product's performance.
