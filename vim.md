## Navigation

`g;` jump to last edited position

## Misc

`z=` spelling suggestions

## Search

Search in current file:

- Forward: `/` 
- Backward: `?`
- Case-sensitive: `/<pattern>\C`
- Case-insensitive: `/<pattern>\c`

Search the word under the cursor:

- Forward: `*` or `g*` 
- Backward: `#` or `g#`

### Grep search

Grep search populates the quickfix list.

```vim
:grep <pattern> <path>
```

Where path can be:

- filename
- glob pattern
- `*` working directory
- `%` current file

## Search and replace

- [sed regular expressions](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/manual/sed.html#sed-regular-expressions).
- [Vim Search and Replace With Examples](https://thevaluable.dev/vim-search-find-replace/)

### Quick name refactor in single buffer

Prefer LSP refactoring.

- Place the cursor at name to refactor and type `gd` or `gD` if you're refactoring a global variable.
- `cgn` to replace the name and escape insert mode.
- Cycle trough find results, use `.` to repeat replacement on occurrences or `:%norm .` to refactor all occurrences in the buffer at once.

### Substitute in the current file

`:s` current line
`:%s` current file

- `:%s/search/replace/g`
- `:%s//replace/g` replaces last search result

### Substitute in multiple files

Populate the quickfix list with search results.

Using Telescope plugin:
1. Search with `:Telescope live_grep`.
2. Optionally filter Telescope results with `<Tab>`.
3. Send results to quickfix list: `<M>q` selected, `<C>q` all results.

Additionally filter quickfix list with [:Cfilter](https://neovim.io/doc/user/quickfix.html#%3ACfilter)

Execute search and replace command with `:cdo` in each valid entry in the quickfix list:

```vim
:cdo s/foo/bar/
```

Save all modified buffers:

```vim
:cfdo | up
```
